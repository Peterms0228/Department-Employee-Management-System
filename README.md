## Create Your Own Branch

1. Create a new branch with your name to work on the project. For example, if your name is John Doe, create a branch called "john-doe-branch".

## Project Setup

1. Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr:
    - Project Type: Maven Project
    - Language: Java
    - Spring Boot Version: 2.7.13
    - Project Metadata: Customize as needed
    - Packaging: Jar
    - Java Version: 17

        - Spring Web
        - Spring Data JPA
        - MySQL Driver

2. Import the generated project file into Intellij:
    - Create a new workspace in Intellij.
    - Import the project file generated by Spring Initializr into your workspace.

## Entity Classes

1. Create two entity classes:
    - Department: Define the expected fields for this entity.
    - Employee: Define the expected fields for this entity.

2. Establish the relationship between the entities:
    - One department can have multiple employees.
    - One employee can belong to only one department.

## Database Setup

1. Create a new empty database (the database name can be anything).

2. Create two DDL scripts based on the entity classes created in the previous step.

3. Execute the two DDL scripts on the newly created database.

## Functionality

2. Implement basic CRUD functions for each entity in the REST controller class.

3. Use Postman to trigger the REST controller and test the CRUD operations.

## Commit and Push Changes

Note: Make sure to configure your application.properties or application.yml file with the necessary database connection details and other configurations.
